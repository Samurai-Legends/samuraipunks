## What is this repository?

This repository contains the code for the SamuraiPunks project, a web application built
with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). The application allows users to browse their unique SamuraiPunks characters,
each with their own distinct traits and attributes.

## How does it work?

Upon clicking the `[Generate]` button, a server-side function is called, which turns the original NFT into a SamuraiPunk
equivalent. This can then be downloaded as a PNG image by clicking the `[Download]` button below the image.
